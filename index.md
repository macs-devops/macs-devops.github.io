Hi! 
Iâ€™m a senior DataOps with experience in construction of a data lake, automation and orchestration of processes and deployment of infrastructure for data engineering teams with kubernetes or terraform, among other things!

I have many years of experience working with BI, Big Data, Data Engineering and most recently DevOps teams.
Using agile methodologies and also proposing the use of good practices, code refactoring and process automation.

I worked in market research, banking and fintech companies.

Along the way, different projects and different talents with whom I worked have internalized me in the business rules and how different teams work and the difficulties and dependencies with which they must deal on a daily basis.
This knowledge gave me the opportunity to add value to the business by detecting vulnerabilities and also optimizing processes and resources.

I live in Argentina but I am willing to relocate, I am not actively looking for a job but I know how to listen, so you can contact me if you think my profile matches your project.
